This is a project with all of my best python projects that i currently have access to. The regression does as expected. The cookie_clicker_auto is a bot to play cookie clicker.
The PLanetsSim is a physics simulation of a 2d planet rotating around a sun. Titan-3D-Rendering is a 3d rendering program made by my fake company 'Titan Co'.
The UlamSpital is a grapher of the ulam spiral, press up arrow to zoom out (toggle) and down arrow to zoom in (toggle). Grapher is a simple graphing calculator i made,
type to enter function, tab to enter function (enter messes it up). Maze sover random is a simple maze solving algorith i made to solve mazes. it picks a random poen direction
and backtracks if it hits a dead end. I have others but they are on my laptop that i lost. They are BFS and DFS algorithms, they use a tree graph instead of a list/matix like
the other one does. 
The intFinding program find the integers in a given string Ex: "1x^2 + 2x + 9 = 10", i have it set up to get rid of the ^2 because i used it for a quadratics solving program.
Segment partitions allows you to set a ratio (in code) and place 2 points on the black screen with left click, and on the 3rd click it will place another dot partioning the 
segment into the ratio specified.
