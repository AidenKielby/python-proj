This is a project with all of my best Python projects that I currently have access to. The regression does as expected. The cookie_clicker_auto is a bot to play Cookie Clicker. The PlanetsSim is a physics simulation of a 2D planet rotating around a sun. Titan-3D-Rendering is a 3D rendering program made by my fake engineering company, 'Titan Co.'. The UlamSpital is a grapher of the Ulam spiral; press the up arrow to zoom out (toggle) and the down arrow to zoom in (toggle). Grapher is a simple graphing calculator I made; type to enter a function, tab to enter a function (enter messes it up). Maze Solver Random is a simple maze-solving algorithm I made to solve mazes. It picks a random open direction and backtracks if it hits a dead end. I have others, but they are on my laptop that I lost. They are BFS and DFS algorithms; they use a tree graph instead of a list/matrix like the other one does. The intFinding program finds the integers in a given string. Ex: "1x^2 + 2x + 9 = 10," I have it set up to get rid of the ^2 because I used it for a quadratics solving program. Segment partitions allow you to set a ratio (in code) and place 2 points on the black screen with a left click, and on the 3rd click, it will place another dot partitioning the segment into the ratio specified.
